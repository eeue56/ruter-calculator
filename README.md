# Ruter calculator

A calculator to find which Ruter (Oslo public transport) ticket is most cost effective.

It was created without a human coder (i.e only AI) - so that I could review the code. I've since made adjustments, but my review can be found as a PR here. You can also see my prompts in the [chat.md](./chat.md) file.

I was particularly looking at:

- A simple, isolated problem.
- Something I could make myself, but I don't have the time.
- A solution with enough code so I could do a meaningful review.
- The AI's ability to understand Norwegian-text websites.
- The factual accuracy of the information presented.

This is part of my on-going work to assess vibe coding within journalism.

### Some context for non-Norwegians

Ruter is the public transport company for Oslo and the surrounding areas. While they have always had period tickets (especially for students), they introduced a discount format based on usage in the last couple of years (Reis). Reis provides an increasing discount for each travel you make within a rolling 30 day period. The highest discount it provides is 40%.

Ruter has faced critism in recent years due to poor service quality, high costs, and aggressive ticket checks.

A tool like this allow people make informed decisions when buying tickets, something which I've been personally missing for a while.
