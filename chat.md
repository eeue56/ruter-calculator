# User Input Summary

_These are my questions / given input to Claude_.

## Initial Request

Let's make a frontend-only website that helps people figure out which discount they should use using Oslo's Ruter public transport.

You should allow users to enter how many trips they expect to make per week, then show them the discount they might get.

The details on Reis are here: https://ruter.no/om-vare-billetter/reis-enkeltbilletter-med-rabatt

## Feature Requests

### Period Ticket Comparison

Okay, great. Now add a way to compare against the period tickets. The period ticket information can be found here: https://ruter.no/om-vare-billetter/periodebillett

### Zone Selection

Allow the user to put in their Ruter Oslo zones. Use the information found on the websites I gave you to add the correct zone information

### Current Discount Level

Allow the user to specify their current Reis discount, so that the calculation can take that into account

### Time Period Options

Allow the user to choose time periods of:

- 24 hours
- 7 days
- 30 days
- 365 days

Use the information from the Ruter site I already provided you.

## Layout Changes

### Section Reordering

Can you move the Discount Breakdown section to the bottom of the page?

### Break-Even Analysis

Can you also add a section that explains at which point (i.e how many trips) it becomes cheaper to use Reis vs period tickets?

## Documentation Request

Can you summarize all the questions and input I've give you, and put it into a file called "chat.md". Only put in my inputs.
